    "Research has consistently linked **salience network** dysfunction to major depressive disorder. The salience network -- anchored by the anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) -- is responsible for detecting and filtering important stimuli. The salience network helps the brain decide what is important to pay attention to and what to ignore. In depression, this filtering process may be disrupted, leading to excessive focus on negative information. Altered connectivity between insular and medial frontal components of this network may disrupt emotional processing and interoceptive awareness.\n",
